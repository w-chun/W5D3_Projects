Using The Specs

Some specs have been written to guide you towards the lite. There are rspec specs in the spec directory and demo servers for you to try in the bin directory.

Suggested Order

bundle exec rspec spec/p02_controller_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/p03_template_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/p04_session_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/p05_router_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/p06_integration_spec.rb
Run bundle exec rspec to run all the spec files.
